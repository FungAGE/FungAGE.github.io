<div class="responsive-text">
Starships are novel family of class II DNA transposons, endemic to <it>Pezizomycotina</it>. Starships can be extremely large (~20-700kb), making up to 2% of fungal genomes. These elements replicate within the host genome via tyrosine recombinases (captain genes). They can also pick up and carry relevant genetic 'cargo', including genes for metal resistance in <it>Paecilomyces</it>, cheese making in <it>Penicillium</it>, and enable the reansfer of formaldehyde resistance in <it>Aspergillus nidulans</it> and <it>Penicillium chrysogenum</it>.
