abstract: ' ABSTRACT Fungal infections are difficult to prevent and treat in large
  part due to strain heterogeneity, which confounds diagnostic predictability. Yet,
  the genetic mechanisms driving strain-to-strain variation remain poorly understood.
  Here, we determined the extent to which Starships—giant transposons capable of mobilizing
  numerous fungal genes—generate genetic and phenotypic variability in the opportunistic
  human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We analyzed 519 diverse strains, including
  11 newly sequenced with long-read technology and multiple isolates of the same reference
  strain, to reveal 20 distinct Starships that are generating genomic heterogeneity
  over timescales relevant for experimental reproducibility. Starship-mobilized genes
  encode diverse functions, including known biofilm-related virulence factors and
  biosynthetic gene clusters, and many are differentially expressed during infection
  and antifungal exposure in a strain-specific manner. These findings support a new
  model of fungal evolution wherein Starships help generate variation in genome structure,
  gene content, and expression among fungal strains. Together, our results demonstrate
  that Starships are a previously hidden mechanism generating genotypic and, in turn,
  phenotypic heterogeneity in a major human fungal pathogen.IMPORTANCE No “one size
  fits all” option exists for treating fungal infections in large part due to genetic
  and phenotypic variability among strains. Accounting for strain heterogeneity is
  thus fundamental for developing efficacious treatments and strategies for safeguarding
  human health. Here, we report significant progress toward achieving this goal by
  uncovering a previously hidden mechanism generating heterogeneity in the human fungal
  pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus: giant transposons, called Starships, that span dozens
  of kilobases and mobilize fungal genes as cargo. By conducting a systematic investigation
  of these unusual transposons in a single fungal species, we demonstrate their contributions
  to population-level variation at the genome, pangenome, and transcriptome levels.
  The Starship compendium we develop will not only help predict variation introduced
  by these elements in laboratory experiments but will serve as a foundational resource
  for determining how Starships impact clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antifungal
  resistance and pathogenicity. '
