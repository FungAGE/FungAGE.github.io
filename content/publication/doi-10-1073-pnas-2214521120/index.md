abstract:
  Transposable elements in eukaryotic organisms have historically been considered
  “selfish,” at best conferring indirect benefits to their host organisms. The Starships
  are a recently discovered feature in fungal genomes that are, in some cases, predicted
  to confer beneficial traits to their hosts and also have hallmarks of being transposable
  elements. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Starships are indeed autonomous
  transposons, using the model Paecilomyces variotii, and identify the HhpA “Captain”
  tyrosine recombinase as essential for their mobilization into genomic sites with
  a specific target site consensus sequence. Furthermore, we identify multiple recent
  horizontal gene transfers of Starships, implying that they jump between species.
  Fungal genomes have mechanisms to defend against mobile elements, which are frequently
  detrimental to the host. We discover that Starships are also vulnerable to repeat-induced
  point mutation defense, thereby having implications on the evolutionary stability
  of such elements.
