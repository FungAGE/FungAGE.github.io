abstract: 'The genomic diversity of many fungal species is augmented by accessory
  chromosomes, which are variably present in individual strains. These genomic regions
  evolve rapidly, accumulating genes important in pathogenicity but also harboring
  significant amounts of transposable elements (TEs). This duality suggests a trade-off:
  accessory chromosomes provide infection-related benefits while otherwise being deleterious
  due to their highly repetitive nature and contributions to genomic instability.
  Despite this, accessory chromosomes often appear to be stably maintained even when
  strains are grown on media, with no plant host. Previously, we had observed that
  genes homologous to meiotic drive toxin/antidote proteins from Podospora anserina
  (Spoks) are abundant on accessory chromosomes in various Fusarium species. Using
  a functionality screen in yeast, we demonstrate that some of these homologs have
  active toxin and antidote properties. We propose that these selfish genes act to
  maintain accessory chromosomes during vegetative growth and may influence their
  spread via parasexual cycles. Finally, as Spok genes are mobilized by the newly
  described TE superfamily Starships, it suggests these TEs play crucial roles in
  forming accessory chromosomes and regions. These results illuminate a mysterious
  facet of fungal biology, a key step towards describing the origin, spread, and maintenance
  of pathogenicity in many fungal species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
  have declared no competing interest.'
